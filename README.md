# Code setup Instructions
1. Set folder paths in the MachineSpecificSettings.py file to load the datasets.
2. Set any base paths and output folder paths in the respective files
3. Run the code in the numbered sequence of files e.g. 00.0*.py should be the first step, 00.1*.py should be the next step etc.
4. Once the trained classifiers are dumped as .pkl files in their respective folders, run *mcc*.py and/or *loo*.py files to read them and predict any sample
5. To process the stats generated by the above steps, we used excel sheets, filtering and sorting etc. the same has been imported on Google Sheets as well.
